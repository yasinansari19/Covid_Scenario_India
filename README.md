# Covid_Scenario_India
This data visualization chart gives an insights about what was the scenario in India during the covid peak phase. Here I have tried to explain about about the the tests taken by the Indian population during the whole phase and then the no. of deaths per day.
This project consists of stacked bar chart, Area chart and Line chart for different aspects of Covid 19 relating to deaths, new cases and test taken by each population.
